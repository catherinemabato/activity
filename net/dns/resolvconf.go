// resolvconfConfigName is the name of the config submitted to
// resolvconf.
// The name starts with 'tun' in order to match the hardcoded
// interface order in debian resolvconf, which will place this
// configuration ahead of regular network links. In theory, this
// doesn't matter because we then fix things up to ensure our config
// is the only one in use, but in case that fails, this will make our
// configuration slightly preferred.
// The 'inet' suffix has no specific meaning, but conventionally
// resolvconf implementations encourage adding a suffix roughly
// indicating where the config came from, and "inet" is the "none of
// the above" value (rather than, say, "ppp" or "dhcp").
